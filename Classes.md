Although there are a limited number of character
classes from which you can choose, there are
unlimited character concepts that these rules
allow you to bring to life. Perhaps your character is a
brilliant but scatterbrained alchemist who can rattle off
complex formulas for alchemical items but has trouble
remembering his best friend’s birthday. Or perhaps
she’s a muscle-bound swordswoman who becomes as
immovable as a mountain when she hoists a shield.
Maybe your character is a hot-tempered sorcerer whose
gesticulating fingers pulse with light from an angelic
ancestor. The choices you make for your character
within her class—such as a cleric’s choice of god, a
fighter’s choice of weapon, or a sorcerer’s bloodline—
bring these visions to life within the context of the rules.
The following entries describe Pathfinder’s 12 core
classes, containing the information you need to play
a character of that class from level 1 to 20. Once you
choose your character’s class, the game’s rules provide
optional archetypes that allow you to further customize
her abilities, though these rules (described on page 279)
are not recommended for beginners. Additionally, the
game includes multiclass archetypes that allow her to
gain abilities from other classes.

## Reading Class Entries
Each class entry includes information about typical members
of the class, as well as suggestions for roleplaying characters
of that class and playing such characters in the game’s
various modes. Each class provides your character with an
ability boost in a key ability score, a number of Hit Points
she receives at each level, her proficiencies in various abilities
and equipment, signature skills in which she can excel,
special abilities from her class features, and more. Your
character’s class entry also provides all of the information
needed when she gains levels, so it will be a vital reference
to you throughout the course of your campaign.

The elements of each entry are described below.

### Playing the Class
This section suggests ways to use abilities and skills that
the class provides your character in the game’s various
modes of play. You aren’t obligated to play your character
as this section describes, but it is a helpful guideline.

### Roleplaying the Class
This section provides background information about the
interests and tendencies of typical members of the class,
as well as information about how others in the world
tend to view such characters. This can help inspire you
in how you determine your character’s actions and define
her personality.

### Key Ability
This is the ability score that you’ll use to determine the
Difficulty Class (DC) associated with your character’s
class features or feats. This is called your class DC. If
your character is of a spellcasting class, this key ability is
also used to calculate spell DCs and similar values. Most
classes are associated with one key ability score, but some
require you to choose from two options.

Additionally, when you choose your character’s class,
she gains an ability boost in her key ability. For more about
ability boosts, see page 43.

### Hit Points
This tells you how many Hit Points your character gains
from her class at each level. To determine your character’s
starting Hit Points, add together the Hit Points she
receives from her ancestry, her Constitution modifier, and
the number listed in this entry.

Each time your character gains a level, she receives an
additional number of Hit Points equal to this number plus
her Constitution modifier. For more about calculating
your character’s Constitution modifier and determining
her Hit Points, see page 14.

### Proficiencies
This lists the degree to which your character is trained
in key aspects of the game’s mechanics. This training
is called her proficiency rank, and your character’s
proficiency rank in a mechanic determines her modifier
when she makes a roll using that mechanic. Proficiency
ranks range from untrained to legendary, and the
associated modifiers range from your character’s level
minus 2 to her level plus 3. For more about proficiency
ranks, see page 8.

Each class entry typically specifies your character’s
proficiency rank in Perception, saving throws, weapons,
and armor. If a mechanic isn’t listed in your character’s
class entry, her proficiency rank in that mechanic is
considered untrained unless she gains training from
another source.

Additionally, this section indicates the number of skills
in which your character is trained. When you choose
your character’s class, you also select a number of skills
equal to this number; your character gains the trained
proficiency rank in those skills. If your character has a
high Intelligence score, she’s trained in a higher number
of skills.

Spellcasting classes provide proficiency in spells, which
is further detailed in each class’s entry. 

### Signature Skills
This entry lists the skills in which members of your
character’s class are naturally adept. In most cases, it’s
a good idea to allocate your character’s starting skill
proficiencies to her signature skills, though doing so is not
required. At higher levels, your character can increase her
proficiency ranks in these skills to master or legendary.
She typically cannot do so in nonsignature skills. 

### Advancement Table
This table summarizes the abilities, feats, skill increases,
ability boosts, and other benefits your character gains
as she advances in level. The first column of the class
table indicates a level, and the second column lists each
feature your character receives when she reaches that
level. The 1st-level entry includes a reminder to select
your ancestry and background.

### Class Features
This section lists all the abilities a class grants your
character. Abilities gained at higher levels list the requisite
levels next to the features’ names. Class features include
the sections detailed below.

#### Class Feats
This section specifies the levels at which your character
gains class feats, which are special feats that only members
of her class can access. Class feats are granted beginning
at 1st or 2nd level, depending on the class. Specific class
feats are detailed at the end of each class entry.

#### Skill Feats
This section specifies the levels at which your character
gains a feat with the skill trait, called a skill feat.
Skill feats can be found in the Feats chapter beginning
on page 160. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter,
most classes gain a skill feat, though rogues gain them
earlier and more often. Your character must be at least
trained in the corresponding skill to take a skill feat.

#### General Feats
This section specifies the levels at which your character
gains a general feat. Most classes grant a general feat at
3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter. At each of these
levels, you can select any general feat (including skill
feats) as long as your character qualifies for it. More information
about feats can be found in the Feats chapter
beginning on page 160.

#### Skill Increases
This section specifies the levels at which your character
can increase her proficiency rank in a skill. At 3rd level
and every 2 levels thereafter, most classes grant a skill
increase, though rogues gain them earlier and more often.
Your character can use this skill increase to either become
trained in one skill in which she’s untrained or become an
expert in one skill in which she’s already trained.

If your character is at least 7th level, she can use this
skill increase to become a master of a signature skill of
which she’s already an expert. If she’s at least 15th level,
she can use this increase to become legendary in a
signature skill of which she’s already a master.

#### Ability Boosts
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, your character
boosts four different ability scores. Your character can
use these ability boosts to increase her ability scores
above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if
it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.
For more about ability boosts and applying them during
character creation, see page 18.

#### Ancestry Feats
This section serves as a reminder of the ancestry feat
your character gains at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.
Ancestry feats are detailed in each ancestry entry in
Chapter 2, which begin on page 22.
