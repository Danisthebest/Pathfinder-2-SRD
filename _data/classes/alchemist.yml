features:
  - title: Quick Alchemy
    traits: Alchemist
    action: 1
    cost: 1 [Resonance Point](Rules/Resonance-Points)
    requirements: You must have [alchemist's tools](Items/Gear#alchemists-tools), the [formula](Items#formulae) of the alchemical item you’re creating, and a free hand.
    description: >
      You create a single common alchemical item that is of your
      level or lower without having to spend the normal monetary cost
      in alchemical reagents or needing to attempt a Crafting check.
      This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until
      the start of your next turn. After this period, the item becomes
      inert and grants no effects. If you overspend Resonance Points
      to use this ability and fail the flat check (see page 292), you
      can’t use the Quick Alchemy action again until the next time you
      undertake your daily preparations.
