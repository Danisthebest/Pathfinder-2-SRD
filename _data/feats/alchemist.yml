- title: Alchemical Familiar
  traits: Feat, Alchemist
  level: 1
  description: >
    You have created life via alchemy, though only a simple creature formed
    from alchemical materials and a bit of your own blood. This alchemical familiar assists
    you in your laboratory and adventuring, like any other [familiar](Rules/Familiars).

- title: Alchemical Savant
  traits: Feat, Alchemist
  level: 1
  description: >
    You can identify alchemical items quickly.  When trained in the Arcana skill
    and attempting to use its Identify Magic action (see page 145) on an alchemical
    item you hold, you can do so as a single action with the concentrate and manipulate
    traits instead of taking an hour.  If you have the formula for the item you are
    attempting to identify, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check and treat
    any critical failures as failures instead.

- title: Far Lobber
  traits: Feat, Alchemist
  level: 1
  description: >
    You've learned techniques to improve your distance throwing.  When you throw an
    alchemical bomb, it has a range increment of 30 feet instead of the usual 20 feet.

- title: Quick Bomber
  traits: Feat, Alchemist
  level: 1
  description: >
    You place your bombs in easy-to-reach pouches and learn how to draw them almost without
    thinking.  When you use the Interact action (see page 307) to draw an alchemical item
    with the bomb trait, you can draw two bombs instead.  When using Quick Alchemy to create
    a bomb, you can also draw one other bomb as part of the Quick Alchemy action.
    
- title: Smoke Bomb
  traits: Feat, Alchemist, Additive
  level: 1
  action: free
  frequency: Once per round
  trigger: You craft an alchemical bomb using the Quick Alchemy action.
  description: >
    You cause the bomb to create a cloud of thick smoke in addition to its normal
    effects.  When thrown, it creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot-radius burst.
    You can choose which corner of the target's space (or the space in which the bomb lands)
    the cloud is centered on.  All creatures within that area are concealed (see page 302).
    The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated with a strong wind.

- title: Calculated Splash
  traits: Feat, Alchemist
  level: 4
  description: >
    You can calculate the angle that maximizes the damage of a bomb's splash.  When you throw
    an alchemical item of 3rd level or higher with the bomb and splash traits, you can choose
    for the bomb's splash damage to deal extra damage equal to your Intelligence modifier
    (minimum 0) instead of the normal amount.
    
- title: Efficient Alchemy
  traits: Feat, Alchemist
  level: 4
  description: >
    Because of the great amount of time you've spent studying and experimenting, you know how to
    scale up your formulas to larger batches without giving them any additional attention.  When
    spending downtime to Craft alchemical items, you can produce twice the number of alchemical
    items in a single batch without needing to spend additional preparatory time.  For instance,
    if you are crafting elixers of life, you can craft up to four elixirs in a single batch using downtime,
    rather than two.  This does not reduce the amount of required alchemical reagents or other ingredients
    needed to craft each item, nor does it increase your rate of progress for the days past the base downtime spent.
    This also does not change the number of items you can create in a batch with advanced alchemy.
    
- title: Enduring Alchemy
  traits: Feat, Alchemist
  level: 4
  description: >
    When using Quick Alchemy to create an alchemical tool or elixer, you can enable that tool or elixir to remain
    potent until the end of your next turn, instead of it losing its potency at the start of your next turn.
    
- title: Poison Resistance
  traits: Feat, Alchemist
  level: 4
  description: >
    You gain poison resistance equal to half of your level, and a +1 conditional bonus to saving throws against poisons.
    
- title: Debilitating Bomb
  traits: Feat, Alchemist, Additive
  level: 6
  action: free
  frequency: Once per round
  trigger: You craft an alchemical item that has the elixir trait using the Quick Alchemy action.
  description: >
    You mix a substance into the bomb that can cause one of the following conditions:  dazzled, deafened, flat-footed,
    or hampered 5.  If the attack with that bomb hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or gain that
    condition until the start of your next turn.  Use your class DC for this saving throw (even if someone else throws the bomb).
    
- title: Delayed Bomb
  traits: Feat, Alchemist
  level: 6
  description: >
    When using Quick Alchemy to craft an alchemical item with the bomb trait, you can build it to explode automatically
    after a certain matter of time.  This delay can be up to any number of rounds up to your level, chosen when you craft
    the bomb.  When this delayed bomb explodes, it deals damage to a creature within its square as if that creature had been
    hit by an attack with the bomb (if there are multiple creatures in the square, choose the target randomly).  It also does
    its splash damage (if any) as if you had thrown the bomb at the target. Unlike other items crafted with the Quick Alchemy
    action, the delayed bomb remains potent until it explodes or you defuse it.  You can use the Interact action with a delayed
    bomb you made in order to defuse it.  Other creatures can try to Disable a Device to defuse the bomb, using your Class DC
    for the Thievery check.
    
- title: Fast Onset
  traits: Feat, Alchemist
  level: 6
  description: >
    When you drink one of your alchemical items that has the elixir and infused traits and an onset time of 1 minute, treat
    the item's onset as the end of your next turn instead.  When you drink one of your infused elixirs with an onset time
    that's normally at the end of your next turn, the elixir has no onset time and takes effect immediately.
    
- title: Poison Antidote
  traits: Feat, Alchemist
  level: 6
  prerequisite: Poison Resistance
  description: >
    You can use Quick Alchemy to create a specific antidote to any single specific poison or venom you have identified.
    When imbibed or injected as an Operate Activation, this specific antidote attempts to counteract that poison or
    venom using a counteract level equal to half your level rounded up.  If you use the specific antidote on yourself
    and you have the formula for the poison or venom affecting you, increase the counteract level of the specific
    antidote by 1.  For more about counteracting poisons, see page 319.
    
- title: Precise Bombs
  traits: Feat, Alchemist
  level: 6
  description: >
    When throwing an alchemical bomb with the splash trait, the splash damage does not affect your allies.
    You must be able to perceive an ally to exlude that ally from your bomb's splash damage.

- title: Combine Elixirs
  traits: Feat, Alchemist
  level: 8
  action: free
  frequency: Once per round
  trigger: You craft an alchemical item that has the elixir trait using the Quick Alchemy action.
  description: >
    You've discovered how to mix two elixirs into a single concotion for quicker consumption.
    You can spend 3 Resonance Points instead of 1 Resonance Point to add a second elixir to
    the one you're crafting.  When this combination elixir is consumed, both the constituent
    elixirs take effect.  For example, you can combine two of the same elixirs to a combined
    elixir of life that heals double the amount.  If a creature other than you drinks a combined
    elixir, it must spend 2 Resonance Points to gain the effects instead of only 1 Resonance Point.
