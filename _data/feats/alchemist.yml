    You have created life via alchemy, though only a simple creature formed

- title: Alchemical Savant
  traits: Feat, Alchemist
  level: 1
  description: >
    You can identify alchemical items quickly.  When trained in the Arcana skill
    and attempting to use its Identify Magic action (see page 145) on an alchemical
    item you hold, you can do so as a single action with the concentrate and manipulate
    traits instead of taking an hour.  If you have the formula for the item you are
    attempting to identify, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check and treat
    any critical failures as failures instead.

- title: Quick Bomber
  traits: Feat, Alchemist
  level: 1
  description: >
    You place your bombs in easy-to-reach pouches and learn how to draw them almost without
    thinking.  When you use the Interact action (see page 307) to draw an alchemical item
    with the bomb trait, you can draw two bombs instead.  When using Quick Alchemy to create
    a bomb, you can also draw one other bomb as part of the Quick Alchemy action.
    
- title: Smoke Bomb
  traits: Feat, Alchemist, Additive
  level: 1
  action: 1
  frequency: Once per round
  trigger: You craft an alchemical bomb using the Quick Alchemy action.
  description: >
    You cause the bomb to create a cloud of thick smoke in addition to its normal
    effects.  When thrown, it creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot-radius burst.
    You can choose which corner of the target's space (or the space in which the bomb lands)
    the cloud is centered on.  All creatures within that area are concealed (see page 302).
    The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated with a strong wind.
