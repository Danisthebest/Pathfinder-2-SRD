## Pathfinder 2 SRD

The Pathfinder 2 SRD is an unofficial hypertext reference document for the second edition of the Pathfinder role-playing game, which is licensed under the Open Game License. Note that Pathfinder 2 is currently in the beta/playtesting phase, so many of the rules and features are likely to change. Currently, we're working on copying the rulebook verbatim to the SRD, but we hope to offer additional information not available in the text, along with hyperlinking.
