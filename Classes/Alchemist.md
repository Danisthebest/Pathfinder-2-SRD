# Alchemist
> There’s no sight more beautiful to you than a strange brew bubbling
in your laboratory’s beakers, and you consume your various creations
with abandon. Perhaps you’re fascinated with uncovering the secrets of
magic and science, or perhaps you simply like to watch volatile chemical
reactions. Regardless, you’re constantly experimenting in your lab or on
the go with inventive concoctions tweaked for any eventuality. With your
fearlessness in the face of risk, your unique path toward greatness is lined
with alchemical brews that push your mind and body to their limits.
